## Ol√°!!!
I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Department of Psychosis Studies at King's College London. I am also an Assistant Professor in the Centre of Computing, Cognition, and Mathematics at the Universidade Federal do ABC. I study the application of machine learning in neuroimaging, neuropsychiatry, and neurosciences.
